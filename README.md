# schafkopf
this project is trying to implement a server for the [CSP](PROTOCOL.md).

# a note on security
the current implementation is NOT secure, just because it is too much
of a hassle to get rsa or sth out of python. this is simply not a goal
of this, schafkopf is a not game you play against randos from russia.
